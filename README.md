# GoldMind Challenge (GMC)

GoldMind Challenge (GMC) is an AI-assisted interactive quiz platform inspired by popular game shows like *Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC)*.

The application delivers a premium, game-show-style experience with progressive difficulty, timed questions, lifelines, leaderboards, and a personalized certificate for users who complete all rounds.

This project represents an end-to-end **product concept, system design, and AI-assisted prototype**.

## Project Goals

- Create an engaging, gamified quiz experience
- Simulate real game-show mechanics in a web application
- Combine UX design, game logic, and AI assistance
- Demonstrate product thinking and full-stack system planning

---

## My Role & Contribution

I was responsible for:

- Original idea and concept creation  
- Designing complete game rules and progression logic  
- Planning user flow across all pages  
- Designing UI structure and component layout  
- Defining lifeline behavior and timer rules  
- Planning API responsibilities and data flow  
- Writing system instructions for AI-assisted code generation  

**Important note:**  
The codebase was generated using **Google AI Studio** based on my instructions and design decisions.  
This project focuses on **system design, UX, and architecture**, not manual low-level coding.
